In object oriented abstractions you often model real things as Perl classes.
Unfortunately, the Perl classes have uglier names than the real things do.

For example, I might model a customer using a Foo::Customer class.

It would be useful if the Foo::Customer class knew what I would call its
associated real thing.

UNIVERSAL::moniker enables classes to make a good guess at what they would be
called in the real world.

	Foo::User->moniker eq "user";

	my $a = Big::Scary::Animal->new;
	$c->moniker eq "animal";

	my $o = Cephalopod::Octopus->new;
	$o->plural_moniker eq "octopuses";
